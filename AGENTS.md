# Agent guide

## Filing issues for the autonomous loop

Issues here are picked up by an autonomous coding loop (dispatch → foreman), and two
parts of the body feed deterministic reviewer rails. Agents filing issues in this repo
must include both.

**1. State the ask in one imperative sentence.** The reviewer quotes it verbatim to
prove it actually read the issue. If it can only paraphrase, its GO is demoted to NO-GO
unless the rail below vouches — costing a revision cycle and an escalation review.

**2. Name the concrete file paths the fix is expected to touch** (backticks are fine).
The scope-overlap rail vouches for a diff that touches a named file, and that vouch is
what survives a paraphrased ask.

Name only paths you are confident about. An issue that names files the diff does *not*
touch is read as scope drift and also gets the change rejected — so when unsure, name
none rather than guessing.
